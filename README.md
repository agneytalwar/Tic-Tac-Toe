# Tic-Tac-Toe

I have designed Tic-Tac-Toe using the minimax algorithm to find the optimal move <br/>
The program prompts the user to choose the character they want to pay with i.e. "X" or "O" as "Do you want to play with X?(Y/N)"
In the first game the program randomly decides who will play first move .In subsequent games the first move is alternated.
The program first asks for the row of the cell in which you want to play your move.
After pressing enter it prompts you to enter the column of the cell in which you want to play your move.
Note that the row can be 1,2,3 and column can be 1,2,3.

Command: python3 tictactoe.py
