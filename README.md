# Tic-Tac-Toe

I have designed Tic-Tac-Toe using the minimax algorithm to find the optimal move <br/> 
The program prompts the user to choose the character they want to pay with i.e. "X" or "O" as "Do you want to play with X?(Y/N)" <br/>
In the first game the program randomly decides who will play first move .In subsequent games the first move is alternated. <br/>
The program first asks for the row of the cell in which you want to play your move. <br/>
After pressing enter it prompts you to enter the column of the cell in which you want to play your move. <br/>
Note that the row can be 1,2,3 and column can be 1,2,3. <br/>

Command: python3 tictactoe.py <br/>
